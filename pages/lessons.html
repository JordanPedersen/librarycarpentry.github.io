Some data that is available on the web is presented in a format that makes it easier to collect and use it, for example in the form of downloadable comma-separated values (CSV) datasets that can then be imported in a spreadsheet or loaded into a data analysis script. Often however, even though it is publicly available, data is not readily available for reuse. For example it can be contained in a PDF, or a table on a website, or spread across multiple web pages. There are a variety of ways to scrape a website to extract information for reuse. In its simplest form, this can be achieved by copying and pasting snippets from a web page, but this can be unpractical if there is a large amount of data to be extracted, or if it spread over a large number of pages. Instead, specialized tools and techniques can be used to automate this process, by defining what sites to visit, what information to look for, and whether data extraction should stop once the end of a page has been reached, or whether to follow hyperlinks and repeat the process recursively. Automating web scraping also allows to define whether the process should be run at regular intervals and capture changes in the data.",

<h3 id="-core-curriculum"><a id="core-curriculum"></a>Our Core Curriculum</h3>

<p>Our Core Curriculum consists of the lessons in the table below. These have been taught many times, and have been further refined 
   after instructor and learner feedback. For more information regarding core lessons and workshops, see <a href="/workshops/">Our Workshops</a>.</p>

<p>The lessons introduce terms, phrases, and concepts in software development and data science, how to best work with 
   data structures, and use regular expressions in searches. We introduce the Unix-style command line interface, and teach 
   basic shell navigation, as well as the use of `loops` and pipes for linking shell commands. We also introduce
   `grep` for searching and subsetting data across files. Exercises cover the counting and mining of data. In addition, we 
   cover working with OpenRefine to transform and clean data, and the benefits of working collaboratively via Git/GitHub and 
   using version control to track your work.</p>

<h3 id="-experimental-curriculum"><a id="experimental-curriculum"></a>Experimental/Conceptual Curriculum</h3>

<p>The following Etherpad contains Library Carpentry experimental/conceptual lessons that are currently being discussed and/or under development.</p>

<h4 id="lessons"><a href="https://pad.carpentries.org/lc-experimental-lessons">Lessons Under Development</a> (<a href="https://pad.carpentries.org/lc-experimental-lessons/export/html">HTML version</a>)</h4>

<h4 id="lessons"><a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/Top-10-FAIR/">Top 10 FAIR Data & Software Things</a> (Pilot)</h4>

<hr />

<h3 id="-lesson-status"><a id="lesson-status"></a>Lesson Status</h3>

<p>Our lessons are in various stages of development - stable, beta, alpha, and conceptual.</p>

<h4 id="-lesson-stable"><a id="lesson-stable"></a>Stable</h4>

<p>These lessons are mature and ready to be taught. Most have been taught multiple times. The content is well-established, 
but minor changes and improvements (e.g. better explanations, spelling/grammar corrections, improved exercises) are always welcome.</p>

<h4 id="-lesson-beta"><a id="lesson-beta"></a>Beta</h4>

<p>These lessons are largely complete and should be ready to teach, but would benefit from improvements based on feedback 
from instructors who have taught them. New sections and rewrites/reorganisations of existing sections will be considered.</p>

<h4 id="-lesson-alpha"><a id="lesson-alpha"></a>Alpha</h4>

<p>These lessons are under active development and may not be ready to teach without additional preparation and background knowledge. 
Further development work is strongly encouraged - please get in touch or check out outstanding issues on GitHub to find out 
   what is needed.</p>

<h4 id="-lesson-conceptual"><a id="lesson-conceptual"></a>Conceptual</h4>

<p>These lessons are still in the conceptual phase where community members have just started to discuss general ideas
   , learner profiles, goals, summative and fomative assessments, concept maps, software and data to be used, how long the lesson 
   should be, and connecting the dots before moving to the <strong>alpha</strong> phase.</p>

<h4 id="-lesson-contributing"><a id="lesson-contributing"></a>Contributing to Lessons</h4>

<p>All contributions are welcome. The level of work may vary depending on the status of the lesson. We recommend that 
   you <strong>@mention</strong> the Maintainers of the lesson if you are picking up the tasks described in one of the open  
   lesson issues or pull requests.</p>

<h4 id="-lesson-development"><a id="lesson-development"></a>Lesson Development Process</h4>

<p><strong>Our recommended process for developing a new lesson is as follows:</strong>
<ul>
   <li>Develop the initial content on GitHub using the Carpentries' <a href="http://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/setup.html">set up instructions</a> for new lessons. 
New lessons are built from clones of <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/styles">this repo</a>.
   <li>Introduce yourself and the lesson on our <a href="https://gitter.im/LibraryCarpentry/Lobby">Gitter channel</a> or 
      <a href="https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss-library-carpentry">Topicbox list</a>  — there may well be willing volunteers to help with the content.
   <li>Teach the lesson, collect feedback, and perhaps raise issues or pull requests to improve the content.</li>
   <li>Propose your lesson for the incubator by making a pull request (PR) against the Library Carpentry website, adding a
link to your lesson repository as an <strong>alpha</strong> lesson.
      <li>Discuss the lesson with the community and, if necessary, offer suggestions on how to improve the lesson; 
         if the lesson is considered suitable material for the Library Carpentry curriculum, a website maintainer will 
         merge your PR into the main site</li>
   <li>You and others will teach the lesson, collect feedback, and improve the content.</li>
   <li>Propose your lesson for beta/stable by making a pull request against the Library Carpentry website, 
      updating the status of your lesson.</li>
   <li>Discuss the lesson further with the community; when the lesson is ready, a website maintainer will merge your 
      pull request(PR).</li>
   <li>Congratulations! Your lesson is now part of stable Library Carpentry!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4 id="-lesson-expectations"><a id="lesson-expectations"></a>New Lesson Expectations</h4>

<p>In order to maintain consistent quality and style in the Library Carpentry lessons, we have a community-driven 
set of expectations for what a good lesson should look like. These should guide the review process at steps 5 and 8 
above. Lesson developers and reviewers should also review The Carpentries Handbook, especially the section on 
   <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/index.html">Lesson Development</a> and consult with the <a href="/cac/">Curriculum Advisory Committee</a>.</p>

<h4 id="-stable-lessons"><a id="stable-lessons"></a>All stable lessons should:</h4>
<p>
<ul>
   <li>have at least three active Maintainers.
   <li>include a short <a href="">learner profile</a> (i.e. who the lesson is designed for).</li>
   <li>include concrete learning objectives.</li>
   <li>be teachable in around three hours under normal circumstances.</li>
</ul>
</p>

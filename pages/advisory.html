<h2>Library Carpentry Advisory Group</h2>

<p>The Advisory Group acts as a critical friend to Carpentries governance and staff and advises on ways to foster greater participation in the Library Carpentry community. The Group meets asynchronously online via Slack and occasionally via Zoom to discuss, plan, and pursue strategies for involving new and current members in Library Carpentry. Members of the Group rotate in and out on a yearly and bi-yearly basis. It is not a governance group and does not make decisions for the Library Carpentry community. <em>Note: Formerly known as the <a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/team/">Library Carpentry Governance Group</a>.</em></p>

<h4>2019-2020 Goals:</h4>
The following list of goals is a prioritised list, voted on by all members of the Advisory Group and refined by the chair and coordinator into actionable goals (in July 2019). Advisory Group members will work on moving these goals forward over two years, from 2019-2020.
